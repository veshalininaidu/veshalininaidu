- 👋 Hi, I’m Vesha, I'm a disabled, Malaysian Indian multidiscplinary artist based in stolen Temuan land, Malaysia.
- 👀 I’m interested in Racial, Gender, and Disability Justice centered and informed TTRPG, video games, storytelling, performance, theatre; everything a nerdy anarchist art person would be into.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Blender! And slowly honing my skills as a designer and illustrator wherever I can.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on full-time/contract illustration and graphic design work. I have experience illustrating for tabletop, books, human rights organisations, small businesses and individuals.
